# hoodfuture.github.io
repository for the hoodfuture website!

So at the moment [jm](http://github.com/jermainemontiel) is researching the technologies we wanna use to build the site. It'll be mostly static so using a static site generator might be the way to go.

Here's a few we're looking at:
  - [Hexo](http://hexo.io)
  - [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)
  - [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io)
  - [Ghost](http://ghost.org) (this one is cool because 1. it's built in JavaScript, 2, it's open source, 3. it's a site generator and a CMS)

Since static site generators don't usually come with a CMS, we'll have to look at those too. (and they usually cost money) We could always come back to some of these when we grow the site and if we'll need the hosting space.
  - [Prose](http://prose.io) (open source, and only needs repo authorization to manage content in the browser)
  - [Contentful](http://contentful.com)
  - [Prismic](http://prismic.io)

It's quite a bit to figure out. But it'll all come together quickly!
